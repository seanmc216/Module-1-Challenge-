## Description

I have slightly modified a project called Module 1 Accessibility Challenge, the URL is https://seanmc216.github.io/Module-1-Challenge-/: A screenshot of the finished site with my (few) background changes: ![Horiseon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103222228/207405914-f791af49-ae7a-41be-976f-d3a3051c766d.png)

The website works as intended. 
```<alt>``` tags have been added and a title tag with a ```<div class="hero">``` tag as appropriate. Also, a ```<nav>``` tag was added within the header.
